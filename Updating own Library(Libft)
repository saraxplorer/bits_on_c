**#When adding a new function to the library:**

-Add the .c and .h files of the function to be added, in the libft folder
-Skip the corresponding Makefiles
-Make sure all functions' parameters and returns are EXACTLY the same as main library, here, known as libft.
-Add the names of the new .c files in the Library's Makefile
-make (you have to be in the folder of the library)
-if you change anything inside the library, you have to make it each time**

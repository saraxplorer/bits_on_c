 i++ vs str[i]++:

i++:

This expression increments the value of the variable i. it means i + 1;
It does not move any pointer.
It simply updates the value of i by 1, so i points to the next index in the sequence, typically used in loops for iteration.


str[i]++:

This expression increments the value of the character stored at index i in the string str.
It does not move any pointer either.
It accesses the character at index i, increments its value, and stores the result back in the same location.
This is commonly used to modify characters in a string, for example, converting lowercase letters to uppercase or vice versa.
For example, if str[i] initially stores the character 'A' (which corresponds to the ASCII value 65), then after str[i]++,
it will store 'B' (which corresponds to the ASCII value 66).

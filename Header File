#Why do we use header file?
-we declare functions and variables here. It is like a menu.
-It enables auto-suggestions in VS code when we are trying to use functions from library.

##ifndef  & # endif works as a guard against multiple inclusions.     
#ifndef: Stands for "if not defined". It checks whether a particular macro has not been defined yet. If the macro has not been defined, the code between #ifndef and #endif is included. If the macro has been defined, the code is skipped.
#ifndef SO_LONG_H
# define SO_LONG_H
_H is just a convention to know it is a header file

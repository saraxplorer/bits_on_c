In the if...else if...else structure, only one block of code executes based on the first condition that evaluates to true. 
Once a condition is met, subsequent conditions are not evaluated.

In the if...if...else structure, each if statement is independent. If multiple conditions can be true, each corresponding block of code will execute. 
The else block, if present, is associated only with the last if statement and executes if none of the previous conditions are true.
